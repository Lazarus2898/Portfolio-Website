      The next phase is typically <strong>lateral movement</strong> — the process 
      of moving from one compromised machine to others within the environment.

    <p>
      In Active Directory environments, this often means escalating privileges,

    <h2>Common Techniques</h2>

    <h3>1. Pass-the-Hash</h3>
    <p>
      Instead of cracking passwords, attackers reuse NTLM hashes to authenticate 
      to other systems. If local administrator passwords are reused, compromise 
      spreads quickly.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Kerberoasting</h3>
    <p>
      Service tickets requested from domain controllers can be extracted and 
      cracked offline to recover service account credentials.

    <h3>3. Remote Service Creation</h3>
    <p>
      Tools like PsExec create temporary services to execute commands remot
